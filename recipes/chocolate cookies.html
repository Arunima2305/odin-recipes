<h1>Chocolate cookies</h1>
<p>These are my favorite chocolate cookies!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together white sugar, cocoa, and vegetable oil. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in
        the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the cocoa mixture. Cover dough, and chill for
        at least 4 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into one
        inch balls. I like to use a number 50 size scoop. Coat each ball in confectioners' sugar before placing onto
        prepared cookie sheets.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a minute before transferring to
        wire racks to cool.
    </li>
